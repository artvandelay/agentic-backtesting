# Professional Backtest Analysis: AAPL 50/200 MA Crossover Strategy

## Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates a classic moving average crossover strategy 
on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock during 2024. The strategy employs a 
50-day and 200-day simple moving average, executing long positions 
when the faster average crosses above the slower one (golden cross) 
and exiting when it crosses below (death cross).

**Key Results:**
- Total Return: 12.34%
- Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe): 1.23
- Maximum Drawdown: -5.67%
- Win Rate: 62.5%

## Strategy Description

### Entry Criteria
A long position is initiated when the 50-day SMA crosses above 
the 200-day SMA, indicating bullish momentum...

### Exit Criteria
Positions are closed when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day 
SMA, suggesting a trend reversal...

### Technical Implementation
The strategy uses the `ta` library for indicator calculation...

## 🔍 Technical Differences

### Code Generation

**Basic Mode:**
```python
# core.py
def _build_prompt(self) -> str:
    # One big prompt with all instructions
    prompt = f"""You are a backtesting assistant...
    [300 lines of instructions]
    Write Python code immediately."""
    
    return prompt
```

**Reflection Mode:**
```python
# reflection_engine.py
def _phase_implementation(self):
    # Step 1: Producer generates
    code = self._generate_initial_code()
    
    # Step 2: Execute
    result = self.executor.execute(code)
    
    # Step 3: Critic evaluates
    critique = self._critique_implementation()
    
    # Step 4: Decide
    if "PROCEED" in critique:
        transition()
    elif "RETRY" in critique:
        refine_and_retry()
```

---

### Error Handling

**Basic Mode:**
```python
if result['success']:
    return result
else:
    # Just show error to user
    return {"error": result['exception']}
```

**Reflection Mode:**
```python
for attempt in range(max_attempts):
    result = execute(code)
    
    if result['success']:
        # Critic validates
        critique = evaluate(result)
        if critique_approves():
            return result
    else:
        # Producer fixes based on error
        code = refine(code, result['exception'])
```
