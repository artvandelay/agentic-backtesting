# User Experience Improvements

## 🎯 **What Changed**

Made the CLI much clearer about the 3-phase workflow and what users can do at each step.

## 📋 **CLI Startup Now Shows:**

```
🧠 Backtesting Assistant
Chat model: gpt-4o-mini
Code model: openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet (strong model for implementation)

📋 How it works:
  Phase 1 (🔍 Understanding): I'll ask questions until I have complete info
  Phase 2 (⚙️ Implementation): I'll generate, test, and refine code
  Phase 3 (📊 Reporting): I'll create a professional analysis report

💬 You can:
  • Describe your strategy in plain English
  • Make changes anytime by saying 'actually...' or 'change...'
  • Type 'info' to see current phase and requirements
  • Type 'debug' if something goes wrong
  • Type 'exit' to quit

🚀 Ready! Describe your trading strategy...
```

## 🔄 **Phase Transitions Now Explain:**

### Phase 1 → Phase 2:
```
✅ All requirements gathered! Moving to Phase 2...

🔄 PHASE 2 (⚙️ Implementation): 
I'll now generate Python code, test it, and refine it until it works perfectly.
This may take 1-2 minutes. You can:
• Wait for completion
• Type 'debug' if you want to see what's happening
• Type 'info' to check progress

→ Starting implementation...
```

### Phase 2 → Phase 3:
```
✅ Implementation successful!

📊 BACKTEST RESULTS:
[results shown]

🔄 PHASE 3 (📊 Reporting):
I'll now create a professional analysis report with insights and recommendations.
This includes planning the structure, writing, and refining the content.

→ Starting report generation...
```

### Phase 3 → Complete:
```
🎉 COMPLETE! All 3 phases finished successfully.

```

## 💡 **Enhanced 'info' Command:**

Shows detailed phase information and what users can do:

```
📍 Current Phase: 🔍 Phase 1 - Gathering requirements and asking clarifying questions

📋 Requirements Gathered:
  • Ticker: AAPL
  • Period: 2024
  • Capital: $10,000
  • Strategy: Buy and hold

💬 What you can do:
  • Answer my questions to provide missing info
  • Say 'actually...' or 'change...' to modify requirements
  • Provide more details about your strategy
```

## 🎯 **User Clarity Improvements:**

1. **Clear phase explanations** - Users know what's happening
2. **Time expectations** - "This may take 1-2 minutes"
3. **Action guidance** - Specific things they can do at each phase
4. **Change flexibility** - Clear that they can modify requirements anytime
5. **Progress visibility** - Better info and debug commands
6. **Completion clarity** - Clear summary of what they got

## ✅ **Result:**

Users now understand:
- What each phase does
- How long things take
- What they can do at each step
- How to make changes
- When they can proceed or wait
