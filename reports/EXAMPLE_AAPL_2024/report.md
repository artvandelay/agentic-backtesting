## 4. Insights
- **Market Conditions**: The strategy was tested during a market that experienced fluctuations, but specific market conditions were not identified or incorporated into the strategy design.
  
- **Performance Analysis**: The strategy did not execute any trades during the test period due to the lack of active entry and exit conditions. This led to a passive increase in equity based solely on market conditions.

- **Lessons Learned**: It highlights the importance of defining clear entry and exit strategies, alongside active risk management, to succeed in dynamic markets.

- **Recommendations for Future Testing**: 
  - Define specific entry and exit criteria that align with the prevailing market conditions.
  - Implement risk management measures, such as stop-loss orders and take-profit targets, to better protect and optimize returns.

## 5. Code
- **Backtesting Code**:
   ```python
   from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy

   data = get_ohlcv_data('AAPL', '2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')

   class MyStrategy(Strategy):
       def init(self):
           pass

       def next(self):
           if not self.position:
               self.buy()

   bt = Backtest(data, MyStrategy, cash=10000)
   stats = bt.run()
   print(stats)
   ```
  
- **Statistical Output Code**:
   ```python
   import json
   import pandas as pd

   # Emit structured artifacts for reporting
   print("TRADES_TABLE")
   print(stats._trades.head(20).to_markdown(index=False))
   
   print("TRADES_CSV")
   print(stats._trades.to_csv(index=False))

   print("EQUITY_CSV")
   print(stats._equity_curve.to_csv(index=False))

   print("SUMMARY_JSON")
   end_date = str(stats.get('End', '')) or (str(data.index[-1].date()) if hasattr(data, 'index') and len(data.index) else '')
   equity_final = float(stats.get('Equity Final [$]', 0))
   initial_cap = float(10000)
   pnl_abs = equity_final - initial_cap
   pnl_pct = float(stats.get('Return [%]', 0))
   print(json.dumps(dict(
       end=end_date,
       initial=initial_cap,
       equity_final=equity_final,
       portfolio_final=equity_final,
       pnl_abs=pnl_abs,
       pnl_pct=pnl_pct
   )))
   ```

This structured report provides a comprehensive overview of the backtest results, making it easier for stakeholders to assess the performance and viability of the strategy. Further refinement in approach and strategy can lead to improved outcomes in subsequent testing phases.
