## 4. Insights
- **General Observations:** 
  - The strategy showed a strong overall performance, with a 38.88% return over the year, outperforming the buy-and-hold strategy. However, the absence of executed trades indicates that the strategy may have had limited opportunities or conditions suitable for execution.
  
- **Comparative Analysis:**
  - Comparing the strategy's performance versus the market benchmarks, the strategy outperformed the buy-and-hold return of 36.52%. This suggests that the strategy's signal could be more effective in maximizing returns over a long period, but the execution needs optimization to capitalize on actual trades.

- **Potential Improvements:**
  - Consider introducing more complex signal parameters or conditions to trigger trades, enhancing the chances of executing profitable trades.
  - Analyze historical volatility to adjust position sizing dynamically, potentially improving risk management and reducing maximum drawdowns.

- **Limitations:**
  - The backtest period did not yield any trades, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the strategy in various market conditions. The strategy may need refinement to respond to market trends effectively.

## 5. Code
```python
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy

data = get_ohlcv_data('AAPL', '2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')

class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        pass
    
    def next(self):
        if not self.position:
            self.buy()

bt = Backtest(data, MyStrategy, cash=10000)
stats = bt.run()
print(stats)

# Emit structured artifacts for reporting
import json
try:
    # Trades preview table
    import pandas as pd
    print("TRADES_TABLE")
    print(stats._trades.head(20).to_markdown(index=False))
except Exception:
    pass

# Full CSVs for optional charts/tables
try:

    print("TRADES_CSV"); print(stats._trades.to_csv(index=False))
    print("EQUITY_CSV"); print(stats._equity_curve.to_csv(index=False))

# Compact summary for TL;DR
try:
    end_date = str(stats.get('End', '')) or (str(data.index[-1].date()) if hasattr(data, 'index') and len(data.index) else '')
    equity_final = float(stats.get('Equity Final [$]', 0))
    initial_cap = float(10000)
    pnl_abs = equity_final - initial_cap
    pnl_pct = float(stats.get('Return [%]', 0))
    print("SUMMARY_JSON"); print(json.dumps(dict(
        end=end_date,
        initial=initial_cap,
        equity_final=equity_final,
        portfolio_final=equity_final,
        pnl_abs=pnl_abs,
        pnl_pct=pnl_pct
    )))
except Exception:
    pass
```

### Conclusion
The current backtest highlights the effectiveness of the strategy in terms of return, but the lack of executed trades indicates a need for further evaluation and development. Future iterations of this strategy should focus on refining trade entry conditions while also introducing exit signals to maximize potential returns. Further analysis on market conditions during the backtest period could provide valuable insights for strategy enhancement.
