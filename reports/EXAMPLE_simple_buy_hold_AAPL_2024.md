class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        pass
    
    def next(self):
        if not self.position:
            self.buy()

print(stats)
```

## Conclusion
The backtest results indicate that MyStrategy was successful in generating a return that outperformed the buy-and-hold strategy for AAPL over the testing period. However, the absence of executed trades and specific risk management measures raises questions about the practical applicability of the strategy. Future adjustments may involve incorporating sell conditions or risk management to safeguard against substantial drawdowns. Further analysis is warranted to refine the strategy and enhance its robustness in varying market conditions.
